For my portfolio website I used Bootstrap and custom CSS. Bootstrap has been a life-saver because it already has an existing class structure that speeds up the work. I could have written a full on custom CSS, but that would be a slower process with more chances of errors.

There were some challenges that I had to overcome. For instance, I wanted a transparent navbar that would change to a navbar with a background color on scroll. However, that option was only available using JavaScript, so I can add it later. For now, I opted for a matching background to improve readability. Another issue I had was customizing the Bootstrap buttons in different states. I think it’s better to create a custom button instead, but I decided to proceed with a Bootstrap dark button that fit my color palette. 

As a future UX designer I think I learned a lot of basics of front-end development that would help me to understand the constraints of code when designing. I think people can do amazing things with code, but sometimes you have to decide whether it’s worth it to make the code too complicated.

There are some external assets that I had to use for this website. I took advantage of a navbar template from MDBootstrap that I customized to fit my mockup. I used Google fonts and Font Awesome for icons. Everything else on the website is created by me and the mighty Bootstrap.
